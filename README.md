Beef Grunio is a remake of [Gruniożerca Meta](https://github.com/arhneu/gruniozerca-meta) game originaly made for Gamebuino Meta, remade using [Beef](https://www.beeflang.org/) programming language in 3 days.

It is my personal coding challenge to see, if I can make a simple game in a new language for me. I don't really plan on coming back to it, but feel free if you want to use its source code :)

## How to play

Collect carrots falling from the sky. Use arrows keys to move around and space to change the color of the character corresponding to the falling carrot.

## Compiling from source code

In order to compile the game from the source code, you need to get yourself the [Beef IDE](https://www.beeflang.org/) and open the project in it.
